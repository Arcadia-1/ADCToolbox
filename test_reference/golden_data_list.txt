# Golden Data List
#
# This file specifies which datasets should be used for golden reference testing.
# Unit tests process ALL datasets, but golden references only use this subset
# to keep test_reference/ small and CI fast.
#
# Format: One dataset filename per line (no path, just filename)
# Lines starting with # are comments

# Sinewave datasets for golden reference (5-10 files recommended)
